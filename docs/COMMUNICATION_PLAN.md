## Communication Best Practices

### General Guidelines

**Do's:**
- Be clear and concise
- Respond within SLA timeframes
- Use appropriate channel for message type
- Tag relevant people with @mentions
- Use threads for detailed discussions
- Document important decisions
- Be respectful and professional
- Assume positive intent

**Don'ts:**
- Don't spam channels
- Don't use ALL CAPS (seems like shouting)
- Don't discuss sensitive topics in public channels
- Don't ignore messages
- Don't make decisions in DMs (document in channels)
- Don't be vague about blockers

### Async Communication

Since team may work flexible hours:
- Don't expect immediate responses outside core hours
- Use @channel sparingly (only for urgent, everyone-relevant)
- Set Slack status when away/busy
- Record video updates for async viewing
- Document decisions in writing
- Use email for non-urgent communication

### Code Review Communication

- Be constructive, not critical
- Ask questions rather than making demands
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Praise good work
- Focus on code, not the person
- Use "we" instead of "you"
- Provide examples when suggesting changes

## Meeting Etiquette

- Join on time
- Camera on for video meetings
- Mute when not speaking
- Use "raise hand" feature for questions
- Stay engaged (no multitasking)
- Take notes
- Follow up on action items
- End on time

## Time Zone Considerations

If team is distributed across time zones:
- Schedule meetings during overlap hours
- Rotate meeting times if needed
- Record all meetings for those who can't attend
- Use async communication for non-urgent items
- Be respectful of others' working hours
- Document everything in writing

## Vacation and Time Off Communication

When taking time off:
1. Notify manager at least 1 week in advance
2. Update team calendar
3. Set Slack status and out-of-office message
4. Delegate critical tasks
5. Document handoff notes
6. Provide emergency contact if needed
7. Set up coverage for responsibilities
