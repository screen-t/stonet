# stonet - Release Plan and Version Management

## Overview

This document defines the release strategy, versioning scheme, deployment procedures, and future roadmap for the stonet platform.

## Versioning Strategy

- Significant enhancements
- New API endpoints (non-breaking)
- Example: v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

**PATCH version (Z):**
- Bug fixes

## Feature Flags

### Purpose

- Gradual rollout of new features
- A/B testing
- Quick disable if issues arise
- Beta testing in production

### Implementation

```typescript
// Feature flag service
const featureFlags = {
  videoCall: {
    enabled: true,
    rollout: 'gradual', // all, gradual, beta
    percentage: 50,     // if gradual
    betaUsers: []       // if beta
  },
  advancedAnalytics: {
    enabled: false
  }
};

// Check feature flag
function isFeatureEnabled(feature: string, userId?: string): boolean {
  const flag = featureFlags[feature];
  if (!flag || !flag.enabled) return false;
  
  if (flag.rollout === 'all') return true;
  if (flag.rollout === 'beta') return flag.betaUsers.includes(userId);
  if (flag.rollout === 'gradual') {
    const hash = hashUserId(userId);
    return hash % 100 < flag.percentage;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

### Feature Flag Management

**Tools:**
- LaunchDarkly (commercial)
- Unleash (open source)
- Custom implementation (simple flags)

**Best Practices:**
- Always use flags for major features
- Clean up old flags after full rollout
- Document flag purpose and expected removal date
- Test both enabled and disabled states
